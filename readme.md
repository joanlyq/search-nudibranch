# Nudibranch Search Script

Welcome to my Nudibranch search script! This is my attempt to help increase the search volume of nudibranches in our FB group. Shout out to Gary to provide such great community for nudibranch lovers. 

Personal use only, don't recommend unless you understand the script. 

**Disclaimer:** Use this script at your own risk. I am not familiar with internet or VPN settings, and I do not endorse or encourage excessive searching or any activity that goes against Google's policies.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if you have any dependencies).
3. Modify the `search_terms.txt` file to include the search terms you want.
4. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py --duration 60
5. (Optional) You might also want to use a VPN client.
